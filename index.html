      <p class="css-desc">Null to node is a free web development course being taught in Salt Lake City. Classes will take place every Tuesday at 8pm starting May 28th. No experience is required, in fact, if you have substantial experience this class may not be for you. Location and other information coming soon. Contact us on twitter if you have any questions.</p>
      <p class="css-desc">So what is null? Null is a computer science concept meaning nothing. Literally nothing. It's a keyword in the Javascript language that represents emptiness, and is different from zero. Node.js is a compilation of Google's V8 JavaScript engine, Joyent's libuv platform layer, and a core library. In other, simpler words, node.js is JavaScript run on the server.</p>
      <p class="css-desc">Putting those two concepts together, Null to Node is having no knowledge whatsoever of node.js to being a proficient and budding web developer. Our goal is to take you from a technical tabula rasa, to building functional real world web applications.</p>

          <p class="teacher-bio">I once had an employer refer to me a "Jack of All Trades and Master of Some." I have worked on both sides of the web, being a full front-end developer as well as a complete back-end developer. As such, I've developed a wide-array of skills in development.</p>
          <p class="teacher-bio">I started as an applications developer doing Java and C++ but fell in love with the web after a web development internship with Nu Skin. From there I spent two years with KSL working on the classifieds section. Since then I've become a senior front-end developer for Needle, an incredibly awesome company to work for.</p>
          <p class="teacher-bio">I gathered a love to teach when I was a teaching assistant in college and I'm excited to be in a capacity to help other learn a subject I'm passionate about. I'm particularly excited to be able to teach Javascript, a ubiquitous language with great power amongst some pitfalls.</p>

          <p class="teacher-bio">As a full stack developer in various languages, I love building applications every step from server architecture to client-side user interaction. I believe simplicity is key to success and I love to rework iteratively until reaching a solution that's both elegant and simple.</p>
          <p class="teacher-bio">I started as a designer and once I started developing applications I was hooked, I quickly dropped out of college in order to spend my time learning web development full time. Since then I have had the good fortune of working for Tesla Motors, which is my favorite company on earth, along with living in New Zealand and San Francisco.</p>
          <p class="teacher-bio">Without my skills in web development, I don't think much of this would be possible. It really opens doors, and is a powerful medium. I am really excited to help others get introduced to web development.</p>
