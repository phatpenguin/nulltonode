        Simply put, Null to Node is an experiment. In order to understand what that experiment is, you need understand what we mean when we say null and node. Null is a computer science concept meaning nothing. Literally nothing. It has no context, no meaning, and is different from zero. node.js is a compilation of Google's V8 JavaScript engine, Joyent's libuv platform layer, and a core library. In other, simpler words, node.js is JavaScript run the server. 
      </p>
      <p class="css-desc">
        Putting those two concepts together, Null to Node is having no knowledge whatsoever of node.js to being a proficient and budding web developer. Null to Node is a free web development course being taught by Brian Holt and Thom Allen in Salt Lake City aiming to going from ground zero to being able to get a job doing web development.

          <p class="css-desc">One time when asking a passing stranger to describe Brian Holt in five words, the person said, "web developer, innovator, husband, badass." The venue happened to be his living room and the stranger his wife, but don't let you deter you from calling him that phrase as his nickname, even if it thirteen syllables. When not trying to get people to call him cool nicknames, Brian has found time to hold down a big-person job as a front-end developer at Needle, KSL, and Nu Skin Enterprises. The Helena, Montana native's other hobbies that's he not afraid to admit include rock climbing, skiing, world traveling, yelling obscenities in beautiful, fluent Italian, harassing his Havanese puppy, Luna, and kickin' it gangster with wife, Nikki.</p>

          <p class="css-desc">You need only know Thom by one name: the <strong>Gentleman Badass</strong>. When not backpacking across Europe and Asia (which is rare these days) Thom is taking time out to save the world one website at a time. A native of Bountiful, Utah, Thom has racked up quite the impressive résumé with stints at Tesla Motor Company, Bazaarvoice, Whittaker's Chocolate of New Zealand (yes, he speaks Kiwi,) and Super Top Secret. When not saving orphans from burning buildings or getting hit on by <em>another</em> attractive girl at the gym, Thom likes to rock climb, tour with on his motorcycle, mess around with Arduinos, play guitar, and travel like you wouldn't believe.</p>
